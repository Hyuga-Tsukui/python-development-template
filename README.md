# Python Development Template with Nix and Poetry

This project template provides a basic setup for developing Python applications using **Nix** and **Poetry**. The setup is designed to manage the Python runtime environment through Nix while using Poetry to manage application dependencies, making it both easy to maintain and highly reproducible.

## Overview

- **Nix**: Manages the Python runtime, ensuring a consistent and isolated environment.
- **Poetry**: Manages Python dependencies and application packaging, handling development and production dependencies separately.

This approach leverages Nix for environment consistency without full dependency control, leaving application dependencies to Poetry. Itâ€™s ideal for cases where you want to integrate Nix for runtime control without complex configuration.

## Prerequisites

- Nix (activate experimental flake feature.)

## Installation

To set up the development environment:

1. Activate the Nix environment:

   ```bash
    nix develop
   ```

   This command starts a Nix shell with the configured Python runtime and Poetry available.

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   make initialize
   ```

   This command installs all Python dependencies listed in pyproject.toml.

## CI Integration

In CI, Nix can provide a consistent runtime for testing. You can configure GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools to use Nix for runtime and Poetry for dependency management, ensuring reliable and reproducible tests.
